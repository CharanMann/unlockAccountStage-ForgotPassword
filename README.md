Pre-requisites :
================
1. OpenAM has been installed and configured.
2. Maven has been installed and configured.

OpenAM Configuration:
=====================
1. Build the custom auth module by using maven. 
2. Deploy the custom auth module. Refer instructions: *[Building and Installing Custom Authentication Modules](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/openam/13.5/dev-guide#build-config-sample-auth-module)*
```
Register service and module: Note that for OpenAM v12 use amAuthHOTPExt-12.xml
forgerock@openam1-12:~/openam1/tools/openam/bin$ ./ssoadm create-svc --adminid amadmin --password-file /tmp/pwd.txt --xmlfile ~/softwares/amAuthHOTPExt.xml
forgerock@openam1-12:~/openam1/tools/openam/bin$ ./ssoadm register-auth-module --adminid amadmin --password-file /tmp/pwd.txt --authmodule com.sun.identity.authentication.modules.hotp.HOTPExt

UnRegister service and module (in case module needs to be uninstalled) : 
./ssoadm unregister-auth-module --adminid amadmin --password-file /tmp/pwd.txt --authmodule com.sun.identity.authentication.modules.hotp.HOTPExt
./ssoadm delete-svc --adminid amadmin --password-file /tmp/pwd.txt -s sunAMAuthHOTPExtService
```
3. Configure the custom auth module. Refer instructions: *[Configuring and Testing Custom Authentication Modules](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/openam/13.5/dev-guide#configuring-testing-sample-auth-module)*
4. Configure HOTPExt module with required SMTP server. Enable both SMS and EMail.
5. Create a chain(otpChain) with (LDAP:Required, HOTPExt:Required). Set this chain as default for "Organization Authentication"
  
Testing:
======== 
* Authentication testing for otpChain:
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-OpenAM-Username: testUser1" -H "X-OpenAM-Password: password" "http://openam.sample.com/openam/json/employees/authenticate"
