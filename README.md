OpenAM Configuration:
=====================

2. Delete all instances of User Self-Service from all realms. 
3. Remove existing selfService
```
./ssoadm delete-svc --adminid amadmin --password-file /tmp/pwd.txt -s selfService
```
4. Restart OpenAM
5. Register custom selfService
```
./ssoadm create-svc --adminid amadmin --password-file /tmp/pwd.txt --xmlfile ~/softwares/selfServiceExt.xml
```
6. Restart OpenAM
7. Add User Self-Service to specified realm and enable forgot password flow. 
  
Testing:
======== 
* Unlock user
1. Lock user by authenticating using wrong password till user is locked out.
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://openam135.sample.com:8080/openam/json/authenticate \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-openam-password: wrongPassword' \
  --header 'x-openam-username: test1'
  
{
  "code": 401,
  "reason": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Authentication Failed"
}   
```
2. Try authentication after user is locked
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://openam135.sample.com:8080/openam/json/authenticate \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-openam-password: wrongPassword' \
  --header 'x-openam-username: test1'
  
{
  "code": 401,
  "reason": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Your account has been locked."
}  
``` 
3. Follow forgot password flow to reset password and unlock account. 
4. Try authenticating again with new password. This should succeed.
